Data preprocessing and cleaning.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes customer information, usage patterns, and churn labels. It contains the following key columns:

Tenure: Duration of customer relationship.

MonthlyCharges: Monthly billing amount.

TotalCharges: Total billing amount.
